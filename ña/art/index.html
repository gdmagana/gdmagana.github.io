            i will be filling this out with various things that i've worked on!
        </p>
		<p>
           my art outlet of choice is to play instruments, and i've been working on trumpet the most lately. but i also play oboe, euphonium, tuba, trombone, and i dabble with piano. i have a couple dumb music covers i once made and edited together that are posted on my youtube <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01XswQchqc0/" target="_blank">here</a>
		<p>
            there's also a cursed 45 minute play directed in minecraft that i spent way too long editing during freshman year. if you ask me nicely i'll show you but. be warned. you will regret it.
