                i will be filling this out with various things that i've worked on!

                my art outlet of choice is to play instruments, and i've been working on trumpet the most lately. but i also play oboe, euphonium, tuba, trombone, and i dabble with piano. i have a couple dumb music covers i once made and edited together that are posted on my youtube <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01XswQchqc0/" target="_blank">here</a>
            </p>
            <p>
                there's also a cursed 45 minute play directed in minecraft that i spent way too long editing during freshman year. if you ask me nicely i'll show you but. be warned. you will regret it.

                also, check out this image i rendered in blender with my friend vecent vang! 
                i later went on to be a course assistant for this course, helping hundreds of students learn the basics of 3D modeling and ray tracing.
