                i can't share the code for most of my projects, but i can talk about them!
                here I'll list some of what i can share from my open source contributions and personal projects.

                my favorite project i built in undergrad was a chatbot in <a href="https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs124/" target="_blank">CS124</a> (Intro to Computational NLP) which i currently teach as a Course Assistant.
                this bot would take in a user's natural language input on what movies they like, match those to an imdb database, use collaborative filtering to recommend movies,
                use sentiment analysis to determine if they liked the recommendations, and then continually update the recommendations based on user feedback.
                i built this in Python using the <a href="https://www.nltk.org/" target="_blank">NLTK</a> and <a href="https://scikit-learn.org/stable/" target="_blank">scikit-learn</a> libraries, and implemented the collaborative filtering from scratch.
                code unavailable due to honor code, sorry :(

                i built and published the MacOS native version for <a href="https://github.com/TeamWheelWizard/WheelWizard" target="_blank">WheelWizard</a>, a widely used tool to play Mario Kart Wii online.
                this automatically keeps your <a href="https://wiki.tockdom.com/wiki/Retro_Rewind" target="_blank">Retro Rewind</a> mod up to date, allows you to see online friends, and has many other features.
                Retro Rewind adds around 200 custom tracks to the game, and before this tool existed on Mac you would have to manually patch your game every time a new track was added.
                all you need is a copy of Mario Kart Wii, Wii Remote(s) or a normal controller, and the<a href="https://dolphin-emu.org/" target="_blank">dolphin emulator</a> to play!
